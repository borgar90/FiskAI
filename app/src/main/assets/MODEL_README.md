# TensorFlow Lite Model Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the actual TensorFlow Lite model file.

## Creating Your Model

To use the fish classifier, you need to:

1. **Collect Training Data**: Gather images of Norwegian fish species
   - Aim for at least 100-500 images per species
   - Include various angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds
   
2. **Train a Model**: Use TensorFlow/Keras to train a classification model
   - Use transfer learning with MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet
   - Target input size: 224x224x3
   - Output: 10 classes (fish species)

3. **Convert to TensorFlow Lite**:
   ```python
   converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
   converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
   tflite_model = converter.convert()
   
   with open('fish_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(tflite_model)
   ```

4. **Replace this file** with your trained `fish_model.tflite`

## Pre-trained Model Option

Alternatively, you can use a pre-trained image classification model and fine-tune it, or use the app in demo mode with mock predictions until you have a trained model.

## Model Architecture Example

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load pre-trained model
base_model = MobileNetV2(
    input_shape=(224, 224, 3),
    include_top=False,
    weights='imagenet'
)

# Add custom classifier
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Freeze base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```
